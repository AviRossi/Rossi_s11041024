# Topic : The process of Alzheimer's Disease using the Biopsychosocial Model and the Biomedical Model
- Alzheimer's is a general term used to describe a significant decline in cognitive ability that interferes with a person's activities of daily living. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases in individuals aged 65 and older.Alzheimers Disease is a neurodegenarative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. The most common early symptom is having difficulty remembering recent events.

 - The literature on cognitive markers in preclinical AD is reviewed. The findings demonstrate that impairment in multiple cognitive domains is typically observed several years before clinical diagnosis. Measures of executive functioning, episodic memory and perceptual speed appear to be most effective at identifying at-risk individuals. The fact that these cognitive domains are most implicated in normal cognitive aging suggests that the cognitive deficit observed preclinically is not qualitatively different from that observed in normal aging. The degree of cognitive impairment prior to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to generalize relatively well across major study characteristics, including sample ascertainment procedures, age and cognitive status of participants, as well as time to diagnosis of dementia. In episodic memory, there is evidence that the size of the preclinical deficit increases with increasing cognitive demands. The global cognitive impairment observed is highly consistent with observations that multiple brain structures and functions are affected long before the diagnosis of AD. However, there is substantial overlap in the distribution of cognitive scores between those who will and those who will not be diagnosed with AD, hence limiting the clinical utility of cognitive markers for early identification of cases. Future research should consider combining cognitive indicators with other types of markers (i.e. social, somatic, genetic, brain-based) in order to increase prediction accuracy.

- The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is often based, at least in part, on poor cognitive test performance compared with normative values. The aim of the study was to  examine the presence and extent of an ascertainment bias (omission of affected individuals) produced by such criteria when applied as early as possible in the course of the disease. The study was aLongitudinal study (1979-2008) and was set in Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center, St Louis, Missouri. The participants were of 78 individuals aged 65 to 101 years enrolled as healthy controls, 55 later developed autopsy-confirmed AD; 23 remained cognitively healthy and did not have neuropathologic AD. Areas under the curve from receiver operating characteristic analyses ranged from 0.71 to 0.49; sensitivities and specificities were unsatisfactory even after adjusting for age and education, using combinations of tests, or examining longitudinal decline before clinical diagnosis. Reliance on divergence from group normative values to determine initial cognitive decline caused by AD results in failure to include people in the initial symptomatic stage of the illness.

- Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by chronic and progressive cognitive impairment
and by an insidious onset. Memory loss is one of the key, first symptoms of AD and is associated
with impairments in instrumental functions in their turn due to the progressively reduced
functioning of one or both hemispheres (DSM-IV-TR); these disturbances compromise the patients’
daily living. Such mnestic deficits, especially in the first stages of the illness, may produce anger
and social isolation in the patients’ reactions.

 - Over the years, a number of non-medical and psychosocial explanations and models of dementia have been proposed, due to the complex nature of the illness. However, there is a need for a more pragmatic, user-friendly model which takes into account the biological, psychological and social processes.Existing models of dementia were amalgamated into a revised, pragmatic model which aims to increase our understanding of the factors that may lead to improvement or deterioration in dementia and to illustrate the role of psychosocial factors in the context of biological processes. The model suggests that in both psychosocial and biological domains there are fixed factors (aspects which relate to history or risk factors and therefore not amenable to change), tractable factors (aspects which may be amenable to change), and interventions with potential benefit. The trajectory of dementia is presented as a process, beginning with aging and ending in death. Both the fixed and the tractable factors may influence the severity of dementia, affecting function, the speed and nature of the deterioration, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of interventions. A working case example is provided, demonstrating how the model may be used by clinicians when assessing the difficulties of an individual with dementia and identifying ways to improve the quality of life and reduce excess disability for that person.
