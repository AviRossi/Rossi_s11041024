# Topic : The process of Alzheimer's Disease using the Biopsychosocial Model in contrast to the Biomedical Model
- Alzheimer's is a general term used to describe a significant decline in cognitive ability that interferes with a person's activities of daily living. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases in individuals aged 65 and older.Alzheimers Disease is a neurodegenarative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. The most common early symptom is having difficulty remembering recent events.

 - The literature on cognitive markers in preclinical AD is reviewed. The findings demonstrate that impairment in multiple cognitive domains is typically observed several years before clinical diagnosis. Measures of executive functioning, episodic memory and perceptual speed appear to be most effective at identifying at-risk individuals. The fact that these cognitive domains are most implicated in normal cognitive aging suggests that the cognitive deficit observed preclinically is not qualitatively different from that observed in normal aging. The degree of cognitive impairment prior to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to generalize relatively well across major study characteristics, including sample ascertainment procedures, age and cognitive status of participants, as well as time to diagnosis of dementia. In episodic memory, there is evidence that the size of the preclinical deficit increases with increasing cognitive demands. The global cognitive impairment observed is highly consistent with observations that multiple brain structures and functions are affected long before the diagnosis of AD. However, there is substantial overlap in the distribution of cognitive scores between those who will and those who will not be diagnosed with AD, hence limiting the clinical utility of cognitive markers for early identification of cases. Future research should consider combining cognitive indicators with other types of markers (i.e. social, somatic, genetic, brain-based) in order to increase prediction accuracy.

- The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is often based, at least in part, on poor cognitive test performance compared with normative values. The aim of the study was to  examine the presence and extent of an ascertainment bias (omission of affected individuals) produced by such criteria when applied as early as possible in the course of the disease. The study was aLongitudinal study (1979-2008) and was set in Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center, St Louis, Missouri. The participants were of 78 individuals aged 65 to 101 years enrolled as healthy controls, 55 later developed autopsy-confirmed AD; 23 remained cognitively healthy and did not have neuropathologic AD. Areas under the curve from receiver operating characteristic analyses ranged from 0.71 to 0.49; sensitivities and specificities were unsatisfactory even after adjusting for age and education, using combinations of tests, or examining longitudinal decline before clinical diagnosis. Reliance on divergence from group normative values to determine initial cognitive decline caused by AD results in failure to include people in the initial symptomatic stage of the illness.

 - Efforts to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) at earlier stages as a means to managing the risks of an ageing population, dominate scientific research and healthcare policy in the UK. Drawing on qualitative data gathered across an out-patient memory service and in-patient hospital in the UK, the purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which the hopeful promissory claims of early diagnosis as it maintains the dominant biomedical model for managing AD, are negotiated by healthcare practitioners. In the article, data was collected in two memory clinics and a hospital in a large teaching hospital trust in Yorkshire, UK. Data was collected over a one-year period and ethical approval was obtained from the relevant NHS Research Ethics Committee. Overall, this research was an ethnographic study exploring the role of cognitive screening tools in the process of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in the clinic. Firstly, it enacts a vision of the future filled with uncertainty and anxiety since it restricts patients' experiences of memory loss beyond conceptualisations of loss of ‘self’. Secondly, it enacts a vision of the future through which the promissory claims of early diagnosis are difficult to imagine.

 - Over the years, a number of non-medical and psychosocial explanations and models of dementia have been proposed, due to the complex nature of the illness. However, there is a need for a more pragmatic, user-friendly model which takes into account the biological, psychological and social processes.Existing models of dementia were amalgamated into a revised, pragmatic model which aims to increase our understanding of the factors that may lead to improvement or deterioration in dementia and to illustrate the role of psychosocial factors in the context of biological processes. The model suggests that in both psychosocial and biological domains there are fixed factors (aspects which relate to history or risk factors and therefore not amenable to change), tractable factors (aspects which may be amenable to change), and interventions with potential benefit. The trajectory of dementia is presented as a process, beginning with aging and ending in death. Both the fixed and the tractable factors may influence the severity of dementia, affecting function, the speed and nature of the deterioration, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of interventions. A working case example is provided, demonstrating how the model may be used by clinicians when assessing the difficulties of an individual with dementia and identifying ways to improve the quality of life and reduce excess disability for that person.

 - The biomedical model perceives dementia as a pathological condition that should be diagnosed and treated. It is characterized as an illness with progressive decline, of which you should recognize the symptoms and gain insight into the underlying causes.  Since effective treatment is not available yet, it is of utmost importance to develop effective disease modifying treatment or preventative measures. The central question of this paper is how the development of early diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease is entangled with specific definitions of Alzheimer's disease and articulations of problems and solutions in dealing with Alzheimer's disease in the (near) future. We do this by analyzing the various meanings of early diagnostics in two very different settings. First of all it was conclude that a broad variety of articulations is present, in both settings. Secondly, it was found that, notwithstanding this variety, the huge diversity of ideas appears to be clustered. The study found that the envisioned implications of early diagnostics are entangled with cure and care strategies in various ways.

 - Alzheimer’s disease will affect more people with increases in the elderly population, as the elderly population of countries everywhere generally rises significantly. However, other factors such as regional climates, environmental conditions and even eating and drinking habits may trigger Alzheimer’s disease or affect the life quality of individuals already suffering from this disease. Today, the subject of biomedical engineering is being studied intensively by many researchers considering that it has the potential to produce solutions to various diseases such as Alzheimer’s caused by problems in molecule or cell communication. In this study, firstly, a molecular communication model with the potential to be used in the treatment and/or diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease was proposed, and its results were analyzed with an artificial neural network model. Secondly, the ratio of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease to the total population, along with data of educational status, income inequality, poverty threshold, and the number of the poor in Turkey were subjected to detailed distribution analysis by using the random forest model statistically. As a result of the study, it was determined that a higher income level was causally associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
